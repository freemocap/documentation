# Who Are We?

![](../assets/Lab_Logo.png)

We are The HuMoN Research Lab and we study the Neuroscience of Humon Movement. 

The freemocap project is a research tool we have created to enable us to accurately study human movement in natural environments. Traditional mocap technology requries a controlled lab environment with fancy cameras and marker suits (both of which are very sensitive and expensive). This limits the study of natural human movements in natural environments.
