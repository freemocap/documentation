## Welcome to FreeMoCaP Documentation

Welcome to our documentation platform. It's a live work in progress ðŸ’€âœ¨

For practicel step-by-step guides, see [Tutorials](Tutorials/Tutorials.md)

We're planning to build a Knowledge Base that roughly follows the ['diataxis framework'](https://diataxis.fr/)

...but until then, I'm just going to point you back to the (`README.md`) in the main repository:
[https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap)

We've also got a pretty nice website:
[https://freemocap.org](https://freemocap.org)

Work in progress, stay tuned!!
:)
