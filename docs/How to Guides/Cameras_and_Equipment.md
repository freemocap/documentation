# Cameras and Equipment

## Which camera's should I use?

A big part of the vibe of this project is that freemocap is built to be as accessible as possible. This includes being able to use cheap cameras. 

The short answer is that it depends and you have many options.  Our team will either use [these USB webcams](https://www.amazon.com/Streaming-Microphone-Widescreen-Conferencing-Recording/dp/B082X91MPP) (easy set up but gives us less data) or we'll use GoPro's (more challending post production workflow, but gives us more data). If you're just getting started with freemocap, we recommend starting with usb webcams that are physically connected to your computer usb ports. This will allow you to get accustomed to the [recording workflow.](../Tutorials/Create_New_FreeMoCap_Recording_Session.md) Then you can graduate to using more complicated cameras like GoPro's, and we'll make a tutorial for that in the future. 



**Important considerations for camera selections:** 
- We've found that cameras that cost under 20$ just don't work well. 
- Get webcams / cameras that offer a range of resolutions (like 720-1080 ish). 
- Make sure your webcam / cameras have screw ports on them so you can attach them to tripods. [The USB webcams our lab uses](https://www.amazon.com/Streaming-Microphone-Widescreen-Conferencing-Recording/dp/B082X91MPP) comes with tripods. 
- If you reeeeaaaaally want to use your own type of camera, you need to be able to syncronize all your videos on your own, and we mean frame-perfect synchronization. Each video has to have precisely the same number of frames. So, frame 12 of camera 1 is the same instance in time as frame 12 of camera 2 and camera 3. This can be achieved with programs like Adobe Premiere. 

## How many cameras should I use? 
Ideally, three of the same type of camera. 

## Can I use a USB hub if I don't have three USB ports on my computer?
- Ideally, avoid it if you can. You'll get better recordings consistently if you don't use one. We understand not all laptops have three usb ports these days, but many do. If you absolutley have to use a usb hub, first relocate any other devices onto the usb hub (like your keyboard, mic, etc) to free up as many usb ports on your computer as possible, to which you can connect your cameras. If you still must connect cameras to your usb hub, try to connect the least amount of cameras as you can to the hub. 
- Here's the thing with using usb hubs, you're smashing a whole bunch of camera data into only one usb port on your laptop, which starts to cause issues like frame drops, it may change the frame rate of the recording itself. 
- We'll make a tutorial shortly to show you how you can verify your recording data is "good enough" so you can check whether the hub is screwing with your recordings or not. 

## Tripods
Tripods will make your life a lot easier. Just make sure the tripod will fit your camera (usually a simple screw port on the camera that fits with a screw on the top of the tripod). 

One tripod for each camera. 

## USB extension cables. 

Usb-3 extension cables will allow you to move your webcams further away from your computer, which will expand the area you can record.
