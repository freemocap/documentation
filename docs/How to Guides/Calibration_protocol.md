# How to create a standard calibration protocol for your sessions

## Standard Settings: 

It's good to have standard settings. The biggest determiner of your settings is your recording environment. Recording in the same place, in similar lighting, with the cameras being stationary. 

**If you move your cameras at all, you have to redo your calibration**. 

This becomes difficult if you're recording outside because the sun changes so much throughout the day. So, if you're recording outside, special attention can be made to recording on sunny days, at the same time of day, in spaces where shadows are not being cast on the recording space.  

## How to use the charuco board in your recordings
Wave it around like you just don't care! Just kidding. You know how you paint a wall with a roller brush? Up down, diagonal. Imagine you're painting a wall infront of each camera and move the board around like that. Go slow. 

**If there is glare on your charuco board, it will definitely mess up your calibration**. 
- The best way to reduce glare is not to record with super bright lights pointed directly at the board (aka the sun). If you're recording outdoors, have the sun behind you if you can. 
- The next best way to reduce glare is to tilt the board downwars by about 10 degrees (ish). Not so much that the camera can't see the bottom of the charuco board, but still enough to let light bounce down towards the ground and not back up at the cameras.
