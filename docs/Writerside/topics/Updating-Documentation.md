# Updating Documentation

* Our documentation uses [JetBrains Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and lives at [https://freemocap.github.io/documentation/](https://freemocap.github.io/documentation/).
* PyCharm can be installed and updated using [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).
* These instructions ensure a reliable workflow using that specific toolset.
* Because our documentation builds from a GitHub Actions that triggers from every commit, we require pull requests for all changes.  

> For more about our workflow, refer to [Contributing to the FreeMoCap Project](https://freemocap.github.io/documentation/contributing-index.html).
