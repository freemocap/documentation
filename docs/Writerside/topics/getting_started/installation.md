# Installation

> If you're already familiar with Python environments and package installation, you can get started with FreeMoCap by
> simply:
>
>    **1. Create a Python environment (`python3.12` recommended)**
>
>    **2. Enter command: `pip install freemocap`**
>
>    **3. Enter command: `freemocap`**

## Detailed Installation Instructions

<procedure title="Step 0 - Install Anaconda or Miniconda" collapsible="true">

If you haven't already, you need to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) on your system. These tools make managing Python projects
and environments easier.

> We recommend using `conda` because it is the most beginner-friendly method to create a virtual environment.
> Any other method for creating a virtual environment (`venv`, `poetry`, etc) should work just as well.
> {style="note"}


> For those not familiar with Python environments, it's recommended to use `conda`. If you'd like more information, here
> is a helpful [guide from Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) about Python
> virtual
> environments.

<procedure title="Step 2 -  Create a new Python environment" collapsible="true" id="Step2">

To create a new Python environment with the recommended version 3.12, type the following text into the terminal
and push `Enter`:

```Bash
conda create -n freemocap-env python=3.12 -y
```

> This is a `conda` command `create`s a `-n`ew isolated `python` (version `=3.12`) environment named `freemocap-env`.
> `-y` option automatically confirms the prompt to proceed with the environment setup.

After creating the environment, activate it using:

```Bash
conda activate freemocap-env
```

Now your terminal is set to operate within the `freemocap-env` environment.

Type the text below into the Terminal and press `Enter`:
```Bash
pip install freemocap
```
A bunch of text should stream by for while, and when it is done, enter the command: 

```Bash
freemocap
```
 
With any luck, the GUI window should pop up!

Keep an eye on the Terminal window, as it will provide useful information as the software runs.

> This command downloads a pre-compiled copy of `freemocap` hosted PyPi - https://pypi.org/project/freemocap/.
> 
> The pip package manager automatically fetches the latest stable binary distribution, which is often in the Wheel format (.whl). A "Wheel: is a built-package format that can speed up the installation process, as it does not require compiling the software from source.

To install FreeMoCap from the source code for development purposes, you will need to clone the repository from GitHub and install it in editable mode using pip. Here is the step-by-step procedure to do so:

1. Open a Terminal.
2. Clone the FreeMoCap repository using git:
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap.git
```
3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
```Bash
cd freemocap
```
4. Install the package in editable mode with the following command:
```Bash 
pip install -e .
```

5. Run the software by entering the command: 

```Bash
freemocap
```

... or the equivalent
```Bash
python freemocap/__main__.py
```

> Installing the package in editable mode (-e flag) means that changes you make to the source code will immediately affect the installed package without needing a re-installation. This is especially useful for developers who are modifying the code and testing their changes frequently.
