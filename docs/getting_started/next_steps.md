If you have followed along with the previous guides, congrats! You should now be able to record your own 3D motion capture. We highly recommend making a lot of short recordings to figure out what works best for you and your use cases. It's also a fun excuse to do a little dance or practice your miming skills.

If you'd like to understand more details about using FreeMoCap, including how to set up a recording space and more information on the various setting, visit our [Resources](../resources/index.md) section for more in depth guides.

If you haven't found success, don't be too discouraged. We have a troubleshooting section with guides on [Installation Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/installation_troubleshooting.md) and [Calibration Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/calibration_troubleshooting.md) that will help you figure out common issues. If you continue to have troubles, [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/P2nyraRYjb) and ask for help in the #help-requests channel, or submit an issue on the [FreeMoCap GitHub](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap/issues).
